# LatentDiffEq.jl 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gabrevaya/LatentDiffEq.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/gabrevaya/LatentDiffEq.jl)

Latent Differential Equation models is a powerful class of models that brings great promise to the field of time series processing. [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and the [SciML](https://github.com/SciML) provide all the tools to build these latent DE models. However, the process of setting up those models can be a time-consuming endeavor with a quite steep learning curve for people without a background in machine learning. LatentDiffEq.jl aims to provide a framework that makes latent differential equation models readily accessible to people that needs it most. This is done by providing pre-programmed established models in Latent Differential Equations while offering a high level of flexibility for new user-defined models.
